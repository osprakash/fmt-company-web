# MVP Feature Decisions Based on Technical Assessment
## Updated: February 28, 2026

## Summary of Changes

Based on the technical assessment and product repositioning, the MVP has been refined:

| Decision | Feature | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **CUT** | Smart Clip Suggestions | Heuristics aren't good enough; deferred to Phase 2 with server-side ML |
| **DEFER** | Text Overlays & Titles | Export pipeline complexity; deferred to Phase 1.5 |
| **ADD** | Cloud Processing Fallback | Enables larger videos without browser crashes |
| **KEEP** | 6 core features | Captions, Reframing, Trim, Transcript Edit, Filler Removal, Brand Templates |

---

## CUT: Smart Clip Suggestions (Moved to Phase 2)

**Why cut:**
- Feasibility: MEDIUM-LOW — the lowest rating of all features
- Quality perception risk: HIGH — "will produce suggestions; they won't be good"
- RMS energy + TF-IDF heuristic will rank music intros as best clips, miss dramatic pauses
- 2-3 weeks of development for something that damages trust

**Why this matters:**
A bad smart feature is worse than no smart feature. If a user clicks "Smart Suggestions" and gets three terrible clips, their mental model shifts from "this tool is good" to "this tool is dumb."

**New plan:**
Move to Phase 2 alongside server-side AI clip detection, where it can be done properly with actual ML models on GPU.

## DEFER: Text Overlays & Titles (Moved to Phase 1.5)

**Why defer:**
- FFmpeg drawtext needs .ttf font binaries (web fonts are WOFF2 — not usable)
- Animated overlays (fade, slide, pop) can't be expressed in FFmpeg filter syntax
- Canvas frame-by-frame export = 15-22 minutes for a 15-minute video

**What users get instead:**
Captions (Feature 1) already give users styled, animated text via the ASS subtitle pipeline. Text overlays are additive, not core.

**New plan:**
Ship 1-2 months post-launch once the export pipeline is stabilized and font loading is solved.

## ADD: Cloud Processing Fallback (New MVP Feature)

**Why add:**
- Browser processing has hard limits (200-400MB, 10-20 min depending on tier)
- Users with occasional longer videos need a path to process them
- Cloud fallback generates revenue (2 credits/min) with 99% margin

**What it does:**
- Detects when video exceeds browser limits
- Offers upload to ClipFlow servers for processing
- Same editing UI, just with upload step
- Credit-based pricing (2 credits/min of input video)

**Technical approach:**
- Upload to Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3 (chunked, resumable)
- Process on Modal/Replicate serverless GPUs
- Same features as browser (captions, reframe, trim, filler removal)

## KEEP: 6 Core Features

| Feature | Why Keep |
|---------|----------|
| **Smart Captions** | Core feature, HIGH feasibility, proven pipeline (Whisper + ASS) |
| **Aspect Ratio Reframing** | Core feature, HIGH feasibility, works well for single-speaker |
| **Video Trimming & Export** | Foundation of the product, non-negotiable |
| **Transcript-Based Editing** | THE differentiator. Ship with `-c copy` first, add smart re-encoding later |
| **Filler Word & Silence Removal** | HIGH feasibility, detection is rock-solid (regex + RMS) |
| **Brand Templates** | HIGH feasibility, 1-2 weeks, pure UI/state, zero technical risk |

---

## Impact of Changes

| Metric | Original (8 Features) | New (6 Features + Cloud) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Dev timeline (2-person team) | 14-18 weeks | **10-12 weeks** |
| Export pipeline complexity | 4 filter types | **2 filter types** |
| Memory pressure per export | HIGH | **MEDIUM** |
| Features with HIGH technical risk | 2 | **0** |
| Browser crash risk | HIGH (unrealistic limits) | **LOW (honest limits)** |
| Revenue from cloud processing | $0 | **New revenue stream** |

## The New MVP Story

**Before (v3.0):**
"Browser-first video repurposing with 8 features including AI clip suggestions"
- Unrealistic browser limits (500MB-5GB)
- Risky features (clip suggestions, text overlays)
- Competing with OpusClip on their turf

**After (v4.0):**
"Short-form video editor with instant browser processing and cloud fallback"
- Honest browser limits (200-400MB)
- 6 proven features with low technical risk
- Cloud fallback for larger videos (revenue stream)
- Clear positioning: "for 5-20 min videos, not 2-hour podcasts"

## Launch Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Features |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **MVP** | Weeks 1-12 | 6 core features + cloud fallback |
| **Phase 1.5** | Weeks 13-16 | Text Overlays & Titles |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 17-24 | AI Clip Detection (server-side), Smart Clip Suggestions |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 25+ | Social publishing, team workspaces, analytics |
